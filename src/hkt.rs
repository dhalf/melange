//! Provides a way to simulate Higher Kinded Types (HKTs)
//! in stable Rust (and provides better GATs in nightly!)
//!
//! Thanks to the richness of Rust's type system
//! (Turing completeness), it is possible to simulate Higher Kinded Types (HKT) 
//! by just using type operators (traits that act like
//! "functions" on types) Ã  la [`typenum`]. This idea
//! is developed in [`this blogpost`].
//!
//! As Rust lacks a way to manipulate unapplied type constructors (i.e.
//! kinded types), we rely on lowered representations (types of kind `*` that
//! simulate HKTs) that can be applied later on by using type operators (i.e.
//! traits that act like type-level functions thanks to associated types).
//!
//! This module contains two "kind" traits to be used with constructors of kind
//! `'* -> *` and `* -> * -> *` or any constructor that has these kinds
//! when partially applied. Partial application is simulated by using generic
//! types as lowered representation. The first kind that is useful to manipulate
//! references of a variable lifetime corresponds with the `KindLifetimeType`
//! trait. The second, implemented through the `KindTypeTypeType` trait is useful
//! to represent staically-sized buffers (with type level integers, see [`typenum`]).
//! 
//! One limitation is the lack of Higher Ranked Trait Bounds (HRTBs) working
//! with types or constants that makes HKT parametrized by types or constants
//! less uasable in practice. For instance, using such a kinded type constructor
//! as associated type in a trait forces the trait declaration to have the same
//! parameter. Type constructors parametrized by lifetimes only such as `'* -> *`
//! do not have this limitation as lifetime-based HRTBs are already implemented.
//!
//! We define some stadard HKTs in this module:
//! * RefConstructorPA1<T> that represents a partially applied reference
//! constructor `'a -> &'a T`,
//! * RefMutConstructorPA1<T> that represents a partially applied mutable reference
//! constructor `'a -> &'a mut T`,
//! * LifetimeInvariantPA1<T> that represents a partially applied lifetime invariant
//! constructor `'a -> T`,
//! * VecConstructor that represent a (statically-sized) `Vec` constructor
//! `T, N -> Vec<T>`,
//! * StackBufferConstructor that represent a (statically-sized) stack allocated
//! buffer constructor. This may be thought of as `T, N -> [T; N]` as the resukting
//! buffer shares it representation with `[T; N]`,
//!
//! One of the biggest motivation for the GAT (Generic Associated
//! Types, HKTs used as associated types) feature in
//! Rust over the past years has been the ability to write
//! streaming iterators that are a class of iterators that
//! yield their items with adaptive lifetimes dictated
//! by the actual usage of these items. This contrasts with
//! classical iterators that yield items with a lifetime
//! corresponding to the iterator's own lifetime.
//!
//! One direct consequence is that it is notoriously
//! difficult to write iterators that yield overlapping
//! mutable references in Rust. Because these references all
//! have the same lifetime and alias each other which constitutes
//! a violation of the borrowing rules.
//!
//! We here propose an implementation of
//! [`StreamingIterator`](crate::iter::StreamingIterator)s that
//! use HKTs to adapt the lifetime of yielded items.
//!
//! Note: we could have used the nightly GAT feature instead but
//! the parser does not support lifetimes in trait bounds yet:
//! `T: StreamingIterator<Item<'a> = &'a T>` does not compile while
//! our implementation allows us to do so.
